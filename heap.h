 *  basic binary heap implimentation 
 *
 *  NOTE: Modified in 2018 to make into a more general c++ class
 *  
 *  NOTE: the data type of the elements stored in the heap
 *        is assumed to have the following fields initialized as follows:
 *                 bool inHeap = false
 *                 int heapIndex = -1
 *                                    
 *  For sorting speed, the heap is stored in two parallel arrays, one with 
 *  cost, and the other containing the associated node pointers.

# A-star_GraphSearch
A* algorithm implementation in C++. Used to find the shortest path between two nodes. Tested on 5 different graphs with the results presented in the RESULTS folder.

1) My A* algorithm was implemented into Dr. Michael Otte's C++ starter code by modifying the files simple_graph_search.cpp, graph.h

2) I used Michael Otte's priority queue code 

3) Used Michael Otte's matlab code for visualizing graph and the path computed via A*
